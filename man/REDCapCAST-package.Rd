\title{REDCapCAST: REDCap Metadata Casting and Castellated Data Handling}
\description{
\if{html}{\figure{logo.png}{options: style='float: right' alt='logo' width='120'}}

Casting metadata for REDCap database creation and handling of castellated data using repeated instruments and longitudinal projects in 'REDCap'. Keeps a focused data export approach, by allowing to only export required data from the database. Also for casting new REDCap databases based on datasets from other sources. Originally forked from the R part of 'REDCapRITS' by Paul Egeler. See \url{https://github.com/pegeler/REDCapRITS}. 'REDCap' (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software platform designed to support data capture for research studies, providing 1) an intuitive interface for validated data capture; 2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4) procedures for data integration and interoperability with external sources (Harris et al (2009) \doi{10.1016/j.jbi.2008.08.010}; Harris et al (2019) \doi{10.1016/j.jbi.2019.103208}).
